## Linux (SteamPlay/Proton and Wine)

PythonSDK does not yet work natively on Linux, but it seems to work well under SteamPlay/Proton and Wine.  To load properly, though, Wine needs to be told to allow `ddraw.dll` overrides.  Additionally, the latest SDK release (as of February 29, 2020) wants the main executable name to be `Borderlands2.exe`, so the common workaround of a `Launcher.exe` symlink/copy won't do the trick.  Instead, set the game's launch options (via `Properties -> General`) to:

    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw=n,b" bash -c 'exec "${@/Launcher.exe/Borderlands2.exe}"' -- %command%

Or, for TPS:

    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw=n,b" bash -c 'exec "${@/Launcher.exe/BorderlandsPreSequel.exe}"' -- %command%

Note that using `WINEDLLOVERRIDES` for `ddraw` isn't supported by the Wine developers, so if you experience problems with the game while using this method, please don't ask the WineHQ team for assistance.
